How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

The plus and minus made it very easy to spot code differences.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

  it will not take as much time to find breaks in code.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    you can't forget to save changes.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

  I have no idea.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    this has not been covered yet.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

  you can go back to old versions of code easily.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I am just wanting to learn how to use git.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more

You can go back and see any changes that have been made quickly.

if you forget to commit you may have trouble finding an issue.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

coding requires multiple docs.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

Git log shows full history of the doc.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

It makes it very easy to get back to where the code was working.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

committing!
